++ Brandon: please list the DATA SET url BELOW (and speically
note the license/restrictions).
++ Nicole: work on the Poll Data set (used for calibration). Find one
which has as much data as possible (better for each state, with higher
frequencies). In general, it's regular expression parsing of a web page.
++ Artem: to continue investigate the live data source (for this year)
 --> better for free. (hint: twitter might no be possible.
 	find altnertaive like twitter (like reddit)
	"live data feed" )

================================================

TODO: 02/09/2024 week

*** put several hundred of rows of SMALL data in data/small_data folder
# 2. real model: search for multi-column timeseries forecast in

Next task: add sentimental analsis
==========================

# We need one person to work on ONE child class of the AbstractSentimantAnalyzer
# hints: use NTLK package directly.
